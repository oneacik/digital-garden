# Trap of the least resistance

Sometimes we know what should be the best way of doing something.  
However we pick to make a shortcut.  
Why? Because usually the best path is the longest one.  
Or rather, most uncertain.

This uncertainity exists there to show that we have to learn more.  
It isn't there just to be avoided.  
Keep it in mind for the future.
