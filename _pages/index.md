# Welcome! ðŸŒ±

<p>
    My name is Piotr SuwaÅ‚a and I believe that with good quality and architecture we as programmers can be happy, fullfilled and deliver great value.
</p>

<p>
    If you liked my presentations/opinions/knowledge and would like me to consult/present/teach then contact me (see footer).
</p>

<p>
    I love also to meet casually to have fun, dream, talk about projects (not only technical), startups, hacking our lives and whatnot.
