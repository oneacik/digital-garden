# Knowledge Sharing

Currently I'm starting my journey with tutoring and coaching.  
You are welcome to take part as a beta tester in my journey.

## Frameworks for sharing knowledge 

Knowledge may be shared in many ways, pick one you would like to test.

### Masterminds

[Mastermind allow to work in group to share thoughts.](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/how-to-start-and-run-a-mastermind-group.html)  
It is a nice alternative to retrospective, where we can focus more on each of us.

### 1-1

Come for a coffee to have a talk about challenges you have.  

### Presentation -> Workshop -> Evaluation

If you are interested in any topic from my list I can prepare a presentation for you.  
If your team likes it, I can cooperate with your team to create a workshop fitting your needs.  
Meetings to evaluate progress and readjust direction - included.

## Topics

My focus is on architecture, however, I can also prepare presentation on other topics.
Pick a topic you are interested in ( (+) is already prepared )

- Lean & Processes
    - How to learn on mistakes - lean startup done right (+)
- Architecture
    - Domain Driven Design - how to create cohesive domain model
    - Clean Code Declaratively - allow your code to be easily understood by others
    - Hidden Code Duplication - how to deduplicate common behaviours
