## Generally Speaking

Hello.

My name is Piotr Suwała.
I'm a programmer since childhood and I have worked in remarkable companies such:

- Samsung
- Atlassian
- Aidlab
- Goodnotes
- ...and many more side projects

Those made me realise that what I appreciate is:

- Living stressless but challenging life
- Having clean architecture in par with business goals
- Being curious about people and their perspective
- Living my life with goal of being happy and making others too
- Holding my colors

I love to develop my knowledge by reading and trying.
My favorite (and impactful) career-related books I read were:

- Lean Startup
- Extreme Programming
- Management 3.0
- Implementing DDD
- Clean Architecture

To try my knowledge in practice I not only used it in my daily work,
but also introduced it into my side projects:

- Pandemonium
- Cashburn
- Stampli

Make sure you ask me about them!

In addition to being a programmer I'm also:

- Speaker
- Manager
- Community Leader

### Speaker

I usually attend meetups as a speaker.  
I'm preparing to challenge bigger conferences soon.  
Check all my appearances and topics here: TODO
All my presentations are open and free, browse them <a href="https://gitlab.com/oneacik/lifecycle/-/tree/master/prezentacje%20i%20warsztaty/presentation">here</a>.

### Manager

In Pandemonium and Cashburn I was trying to be a manager,  
however I still had to learn more and invest more time to become one.  

Currently I'm interim manager in Goodnotes and I am trying myself out :).

### Community Leader

I'm proud member of both hackerspaces in Gdańsk.  
I prototype new events in new forms to put back fun and quality into events.


## Technology in depth

## My current objectives

I'm still looking for my way exploring new approaches and technologies.  
It is my motor of growth.  

Currently my objectives are:

- Become a recognizable conference speaker
- Grow my network with people I could mentor and be mentored
- Create a cohesive coding approach which connects business objectives with great architecture
- Find a role where I could be a craftsman creating excellent project and develop new approaches to software development

If you see any goals we have in common then feel free to contact me: +48662117872.  
Don't be afraid to use my time.
